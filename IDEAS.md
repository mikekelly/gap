# Ideas

Raw thoughts, not yet evaluated.

- A fork of exa-mcp-server that relies on ACP proxy instead of env vars
- Drop-in wrappers for common http libraries that handle ACP proxying transparently (exa-mcp-server fork would be a good test candidate)
- Plugins that can initiate and handle OAuth dance when installed
- Plugin authoring guide documentation
